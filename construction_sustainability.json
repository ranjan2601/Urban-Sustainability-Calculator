        "environmental_impact": {
            "carbon_footprint": "During construction, the emission of greenhouse gasses will increase due to the transportation of materials, energy consumption during construction, and waste disposal. However, the gym's design will prioritize energy efficiency, aiming for LEED certification, resulting in lower operational carbon emissions.",
            "air_water_quality": "The construction phase may impact the air quality due to dust, noise, and emissions from machinery. The operational phase may impact the water quality if the gym's waste management system is not adequate. The design should include measures to minimize these impacts, such as dust control and proper waste disposal.",
            "green_space_biodiversity": "The construction of the gym will not significantly impact green spaces or biodiversity in the area since it will occur on the existing developed site.",
            "waste_circular_economy": "The construction and operation of the gym will generate waste. The project should aim to minimize waste generation and promote a circular economy through waste reduction, recycling, and composting."
